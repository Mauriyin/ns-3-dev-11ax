Open Issues in the underlying Wi-Fi PHY model
=============================================

Plots are generally based on one iteration of each simulation scenario, 
and results will vary as the random number generator seed value is 
changed and scenarios are rerun.  An averaging of multiple iterations 
will smooth out some irregularities of the plots.

The Bianchi validation tests would benefit from plots showing the 
theoretical results on the plots vs. the simulation results.

Some Calibration Box5 scenarios crash ns-3
